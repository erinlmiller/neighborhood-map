# FEND Project 7: Neighborhood Map

## Richmond, VA Bar Map

This project is a list of bars in Richmond, VA. Locations display on a map with markers. CLicking a marker brings up the name of the bar, a link the bar's website, and a photo from FourSquare if available. Clicking the hamburger menu on the top left brings up a list of locations that can be filtered via the filter box. When a location is clicked, it jumps you back to the map and opens up the appropriate marker. Clicking outside the drawer closes the drawer, and clicking anywhere on the map closes all open info windows.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), therefore the default service worker only works in production build.
